**Hi, I’m Medelyn!** 

I’m an Information Security Engineer at Mastercard who loves to learn. My journey began as an IT support technician, where I honed my troubleshooting skills and fostered a deep understanding of the technical landscape. This foundation led me to pursue a career in security, where I excelled as a Security Analyst, developing my knowledge of threat detection, vulnerability analysis, and incident response. 

### Outside the Tech
I enjoy long walks, working out, traveling, watching anime, and reading. I’m also a financial literacy nerd and enjoy attending talks or having conversations on the topic.
